# VinylMusicPLayerForCarAndriod
Inspired by Mini Cooper Infotainment System, an interactive vinyl-style music player with scratch effects, Bluetooth support, and Spotify integration. Spin the vinyl clockwise to seek forward and anticlockwise to rewind â€” just like a real DJ turntable! The app dynamically fetches and displays the album cover from Spotify in the center of the vinyl.
